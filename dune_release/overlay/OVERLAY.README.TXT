Overlays for Eversion 
*********************

Overlays are additional processing YAMJ can do with various artwork.  They can be simple effects or in same
cases a complete page for speed reasons.

Your eskin may use special overlays so always check with your eskin for compatibility.  The included overlays,
sample images and how to add them to your setup please visit http://www.dentedboxes.com/doku.php/eversionb2:settings:images

These overlays require YAMJ r2832 or newer to work.

Thanks,
Accident.

Special Thanks:
