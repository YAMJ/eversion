INCOMPLETE SOURCE/HOW TO SETUP FLASH
************************************

Eversion includes code that requires an agreement with Syabas.   To find
the missing pieces, you must signup at http://developer.popbox.com and in
the general forum you'll find the protected download of the missing pieces.

Use the SDK docs from syabas for how to setup Flash for Flashlite and API DEV

All debug code is in the form of trace statements.  When you pushlish Eversion
for use on the embedded hardware, make sure you select the omit trace statement
option under publish settings.

Eversion is published using Adobe Flash CS5.5.  The PHF file is just the swf
renamed

An additional setup in flash is added where it's debugged/published in device central
I'm not sure if that carries over in the FLA file or a flash itself setting you need
to adjust.

***********
CS4 and CS5
***********

As requested, CS4 and CS5 fla files have been saved.   These have never been tried and
it's normally built from the fla file with cs5.5

*****************
UGLY CODE WARNING
*****************

This was in part, my learn flash project.   In an attempt to get as much speed out
of embedded flashlite hardware, I threw out the rules and broke them all in an
attempt to gain nanoseconds.   It's not pretty but it works, works reliable and
used by thousands for their home jukebox expeirence.
